# Blackjack
# Code produced by Zachary Holme


Hi guys this is a small pet-project that I worked on at University which allowed me to better understand Java as well as object oriented programming.
All of the classes are found in the repository and the game runs off the console. 

# Setting up the game


You should see a Executable.bat file in the repository. 

Right click and edit either in notepad or notepad++.

After that locate where your java is. Normally its in program files in your local disk C:. Once you've found the java file locate the bin file and get the directory for that. You should see 'set path' in the Executable.bat file replace the directory with yours! after the '=' sign.

Once you've done that replace the next directory with where you have the Blackjack folder located (THE FOLDER MUST BE EXTRACTED CANNOT BE DONE IN RAR FILE)
cd C:\Users\zholm\OneDrive\Desktop\Blackjack < It's the second to last line. Make sure you keep the 'cd' on the line tho!

In the middle of both directories you'll see 'c:' < that. This corresponds to the harddrive that the blackjack folder is located in. Change if need be. for e.g. your directory might be D:\Users\Documents\BlackJack in that case change the c: should change to this d: and so on. 

Okay after you've done all that save the file and double click on the Executable.bat file. It should run the game successfully in cmd. 

If not you've messed up somewhere with your directories or your java on your computer is old. Also if you have two different versions of java to pick from. choose the latest one (which is jdk-13.0.1).
